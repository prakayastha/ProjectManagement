### Date: 14th December 2021
**Who helped you this week?**
- Aims coordinators for the 
**What did you achieve?**
- Running aims on archer2 now but the free queue is insanely long, alternative methods on 4c or oswald. 
- Complied aims myself (!!) from the git version on Oswald 
**What did you struggle with?**

- Prepare to fill in for Lucy's class next week
- Get aims running on Oswald/Archer2
### Date: 30 November 2021
**What did you achieve?**
- Ran my first VASP calculations, setting up with archer2
- Following the tutorial series for VASP and getting acquainted with VASP

**What did you struggle with?**
- Sent Jimmy a word about being added to VASP group, no response

**What would you like to work on next week?**
- Get started with aims and plans for spectroscopy

### Date: 23 November 2021
**What did you achieve?**

**What did you struggle with?**
- Sent Jimmy a word about being added to VASP group, no response

**What would you like to work on next week?**
- Start on the VASP calulations, this is still not done 
- 
### Date: 16 November 2021
**Who helped you this week?**
- Meeting with Guilia regarding the chalcogenide perovskite project to give a clear experimetal motivation for the project
- Lucy with the monitor, helps me be much more productive in the office


**Who did you help this week?**
- Checked in with Daniel's incoming student and helped her with her application from India


**What did you achieve?**

**What would you like to work on next week?**
- Geometry relaxation of the chalcogenide perovskite, lowest energy phase from Materials Project/AFLOW/OQMD/ICSD
- Run my first VASP calculation 
- Verify if there are soft modes in the lowest energy phase, use the mode map code to find lower symmetry phase
- Plan for spectroscoPY version with aims
- Schematic diagrams for the soft-phonon modes

**Where do you need help from Lucy?**
